# Missile Booster Simulation Web App

This Python-based web application simulates the performance of a multi-stage missile booster system. It allows users to input rocket parameters and outputs calculated results (such as thrust and delta-v) in both visual and Excel formats.

Originally developed as a standalone desktop app, the simulation runs on a local Flask server with a browser-based UI.
